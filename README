Firmware for POV project.
Requires arm-none-eabi GCC/toolchain and TI headers.

License: GPL, v2 or later.

NOTE: When using the Stellaris/Tiva Launchpad, it is necessary to
de-solder the 0-ohms resistors R9 and R10. Otherwise they create a
short between the pins used by SSI2 and SSI3 and things will not work.
